# DL-Project-2
This is my Deep Learning Project where for the 1st part, we developed and trained different models using different techniques to find the best model that could predict the rating of a randomly generated google play store app review. For the 2nd part, I had to create a text generation model that could successfully create sentences and words by itself.
